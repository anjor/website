# Interviews are Unfair

And that's ok. 

As I have [mentioned](./take-bets-on-new-hires.md) [before](./motivational-interview.md), genuinely connecting with the candidate makes you an effective interviewer. Having high empathy for the candidate helps build that genuine connection. However, that makes it easy to fall into the "fairness trap". 

## Fairness Trap

"Fairness trap" is where you, the interviewer, hold yourself to a high standard of fairness. You want to do right by the candidate. It is natural - you have just spent a solid amount of time going through their background, and other interviewers' feedback, and then spent an hour or so interviewing them yourself - it makes sense that you feel a connection. But this connection can cloud your judgment, especially when evaluating candidates who are good, but not great.

## Hiring is Existential

For early-stage companies, hiring is existential. Each new team member can significantly impact the company's trajectory. While you might have predetermined criteria for ideal candidates, meeting these baseline requirements isn't always enough.

When evaluating a candidate, consider:

- What new capabilities will this hire bring to the team?
- How much potential for growth does the candidate have?
- What is their "ceiling" - the maximum impact they could have on the company?

These questions help you look beyond surface-level qualifications and consider the candidate's long-term value to your organization.

While data and criteria are important, don't underestimate the value of your intuition. Trust your gut feeling about a candidate, but be aware of your own biases.

## Empathy and Objectivity
The key to effective interviewing lies in balancing empathy with objectivity:

1. During the interview: Build a genuine connection with the candidate. Show empathy and create a comfortable environment for open discussion.
2. After the interview: Step back and evaluate objectively. Consider the candidate's fit, potential, and possible growth trajectories within your company.

## Conclusion

Interviews are inherently unfair because they can never capture a person's full potential or fit within a short interaction. However, by acknowledging this limitation and consciously balancing empathy with objectivity, we can make more informed hiring decisions.

Remember, the goal isn't just to be fair to the candidate in the moment, but to make the best decision for your company's future. Sometimes, that means passing on a good candidate in hopes of finding a great one.
