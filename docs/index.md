![The Autonomy Gradient: AI effectiveness across research tasks](./writing/assets/autonomy-gradient.png){ width="700" }

I help companies build elite technical organizations through hiring systems design and FDE-style organizational structure.

I write about what actually works in hiring—based on 7 years at Palantir, 1,000+ interviews, and building teams at Protocol Labs and multiple startups.

Recently completed research on AI-assisted physics: AI amplifies expertise rather than replacing it. The effectiveness follows an autonomy gradient—from ~100% for code implementation to ~0% for research direction.

## About Me

PhD in Computational Physics. 7 years at Palantir as a Forward Deployed Engineer and hiring manager. Built engineering teams at Protocol Labs (onboarding 2+ petabytes to Filecoin) and Radiant AI.

I've conducted over 1,000 technical interviews and trained hundreds of interviewers. I built hiring systems that scaled from seed-stage startups to established companies.

Now I help ambitious companies build hiring systems that actually work and structure their engineering organizations around customer outcomes.

I recently completed rebuilding my plasma physics simulations with AI assistance—validating that AI amplifies expertise rather than replacing it. The paper is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/anjor/gandalf-paper) along with the [code](https://github.com/anjor/gandalf).
