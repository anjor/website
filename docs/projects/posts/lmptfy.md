I am a big fan of [lmgtfy](https://letmegooglethat.com/), but I have recently switched to using [perplexity](https://www.perplexity.ai/) a lot more.

So decided to build a similar tool for perplexity: [lmptfy](https://anjor.github.io/lmptfy).

Code is available under MIT license on [GitHub](https://github.com/anjor/lmptfy).
