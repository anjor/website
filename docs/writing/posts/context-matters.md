# Context Matters

Hiring is often viewed as a universal process -- "hire the best engineers, obviously!" -- but the reality is far more nuanced.

Hiring is deeply context-dependent, and understanding this can make the difference between building a thriving team and struggling with misaligned talent.
As someone who has worked extensively in hiring and team building, I've observed firsthand how crucial it is to align your hiring strategy with your company's current stage, technical needs, and overall vision. This blog post discusses three distinct scenarios I've recently encountered while consulting for different clients, each facing unique hiring challenges.

Through these examples, we'll explore:

1. How a solo founder can build their founding team
2. The approach an early-stage startup should take when scaling their engineering team
3. Why a Series A startup needed to shift focus from engineering to operations

Each case study offers insights into the critical thinking required to design effective hiring processes that go beyond simply filling roles. We'll discuss how to identify the truly important traits for each context, how to redesign job descriptions to attract the right candidates, and how to create interview processes that effectively evaluate the skills and attributes that matter most.

By the end of this post, you'll have a deeper understanding of why one-size-fits-all hiring rarely works, and how to approach hiring strategically based on your company's specific context and needs.

## Client 1: A solo founder hiring their founding team

I am working with a product-minded solo founder with a ML background who is looking to hire their founding team. Since they don't have a software engineering background, designing the right hiring process was a crucial problem to solve.

We started by identifying the critical first hire - an engineer who could help drive the technical vision of the company. The job description they had in place had a ton of technical jargon and was focused on the wrong things.
The critical insight here was while being pre-pmf, the first couple of engineers need to have spikes in one of the following two areas:

1. **Highly Creative**: They need to be someone who can explore the product space and come up with innovative solutions.
2. **Strong Execution**: They need to be someone who can take a vague idea and turn it into a product really quickly.

As you are trying to find your PMF, you need to be able to iterate quickly and try out a bunch of different things. This means you need to hire for speed and creativity, not for scale and robustness.

Once we aligned on this, we redesigned the job description to focus on these two areas and started sourcing candidates from our network.
We also started working on a technical interview process that would help us identify these traits in candidates using techniques from my previous posts on [hiring](../category/hiring.md).

## Client 2: An early stage startup looking to scale

This client is an early stage startup with about 10 engineers looking to scale to 20-30 engineers in the next 6 months. They have a couple of products showing early signs of traction and are looking to build out their engineering team.
The current team is very product-focused and has a strong engineering culture. They are looking to hire engineers who can come in and start contributing to the product quickly and autonomously.
The kind of profiles they are looking for are similar to the [Forward Deployed Engineer](./hiring-fdes.md) role at Palantir.

This was obviously an area I have a lot of experience in. The key value add here was helping them design a hiring process that would help them identify engineers who could come in and start contributing quickly.
This was done by first shadowing the current interviews and identifying the key areas where they were struggling to evaluate candidates - this could be questions they were asking, or the way they were synthesising the signal from the interviews.
I then gave the interviewers feedback on what's working well, and areas where they could improve. I even conducted a few interviews myself to help them calibrate their bar.

Even when you know what you are looking for, it is not always easy to evaluate it in an interview. This is where having an experienced interviewer can make a big difference.
During the interview, it is important to be ruthlessly objective about the signal you are getting. This means you form a hypothesis about the candidate, and then try to disprove it with your next question.

## Client 3: A series A startup looking to expand their operational team

This was a very different problem to solve. The core technical and operational strategy of the company relied more on the operational team than the engineering team.
Despite this their focus was on hiring engineers, and they were struggling to find the right profiles, and to keep them engaged once they joined.

The key insight here was that the operational team was the bottleneck in the company's growth, and they needed to hire for that team first. Once we aligned on this, we started working on a hiring process for the operational team.
We also worked on hiring a few key engineers who could help the operational team scale - this had a much wider impact than hiring engineers directly.

It is important to be true to your company's needs and not get caught up in the hype around hiring engineers. Sometimes the most impactful hires are not in the areas you initially think.
Having those honest conversations with the founders can make a big difference in the hiring strategy.


## Conclusion

Through these engagements I learned a lot about how context matters in hiring. Here are a few key takeaways:

1. **Align with Your Stage**: Whether you're pre-PMF, showing early traction, or entering a growth phase, your hiring needs will vary dramatically. Prioritize the skills and attributes that will drive your company forward at its current stage.
2. **Look Beyond Technical Skills**: While technical proficiency is important, factors like creativity, execution speed, and cultural fit can be equally, if not more, crucial, especially in early-stage companies.
3. **Adapt Your Process**: Your hiring process should reflect your company's needs and culture. Whether it's designing creative technical interviews, focusing on operational skills, or prioritizing autonomous contributors, tailor your approach to find the right fit.
4. **Understand Your Bottlenecks**: Sometimes, the most impactful hires aren't in the areas you initially think. Be open to reassessing your needs and focusing on the roles that will truly drive your company's growth.
5. **Continuously Refine**: As your company evolves, so too should your hiring strategy. Regularly reassess and adjust your approach to ensure you're attracting and selecting the talent that aligns with your current and future needs.

Effective hiring is not just about filling roles; it's about building a team that can execute on your vision and drive your company forward. By understanding the nuances of your company's context – its stage, culture, and strategic goals – you can design a hiring process that not only attracts top talent but also ensures that talent is the right fit for your specific needs.

Remember, the goal isn't to hire the "best" people in absolute terms, but to hire the right people for your context. This mindset shift can make all the difference in building a team that's truly equipped to tackle your unique challenges and opportunities.
