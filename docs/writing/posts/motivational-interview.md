# Motivational Interview

## Why have a motivational interview?

Often times companies will do a "culture fit" interview. This is usually done to understand whether the things that motivate the candidate are aligned with the company values and culture. It is also to see whether they joining the team will have a non-linear effect on the wider team - in addition to their individual performance, do they have a positive effect on the people around them.

However, you often run risk of hiring similar profiles and as a result losing out on a lot of candidates. It is important to be mindful about why you are conducting this interview. 

Everyone has a few things that drive them, keep them engaged in their work. The question you are trying to answer is not whether the person is motivated, but what is it that motivates the person and why? Is that something we can give them?

## Different types of motivations

Broadly you can classify motivations in two categories: intrinsic and extrinsic.

Intrinsic motivations are based on the individual. These can be both positive and negative. 

- Do they care about learning?
- Do they care about making their environment better?
- Are they achievement driven?
- Are they an adrenaline junkie who thrive in stressful situations?

Then there are extrinsic motivations.

- Promotion and career advancement
- Do they expect external fairness, and do something thinking that it's fair?
- Being part of a group
- Fear

Notice that neither intrinsic nor extrinsic motivations are necessarily good or bad. It is also important to understand that good motivation does not equate with a good person. Don't hire someone because they are nice and friendly, but hire them because their motivation translates into them being productive. 

## What to ask?

There are different ways to approach this. A lot of them end up in open ended _how_ questions.

- How did they decide to change jobs? 
- How did they choose which companies to interview at? 
- If they had multiple offers at some point, how did they choose which one to pick? 

You can also get them to open up by asking them to talk about something they are passionate about. 

- Tell me about the last time you heard an interesting problem and were really invested in solving it.
- Tell me about a passion project of yours. And then ask follow up questions.
- What was your proudest achievement? What achievement of yours do you think went unnoticed?

Honestly, it is just about being genuinely curious and getting to know them as a person.


## Conclusion

Conducting a motivational interview is not just about identifying whether a candidate fits into the existing culture of the company. Instead, it's about understanding the underlying drivers that keep them engaged and productive in their work. If you manage to understand that at a deep level that can guide your hiring as well as staffing decisions.

Remember that a motivational interview should be approached with genuine curiosity. Investigating a candidate's motivations through thoughtful, open-ended questions can reveal insights that go far beyond their resume. This approach ensures that you are not only bringing in capable individuals but also those whose motivations align with and enhance the team's dynamic.
