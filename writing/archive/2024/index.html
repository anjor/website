<h3 id="pivot"><a class="toclink" href="../../2024/12/23/2024-wrapped/#pivot">Pivot</a></h3>
<p>This year was a huge pivot for me. At the beginning of the year I was working on an AI startup founded by two of my friends.
It was my first introduction to the world of AI, and a great learning experience.
It developed my interest in applied AI - specifically, that area in between research and practical applications. Keeping up with the latest research, and then figuring out how to apply it to real-world problems.</p>
<p>However, by April I realised I needed a break. My partner pointed out that I had not taken a proper break since starting grad school, back in August 2008
And since then I had only worked at intense places - a PhD, Palantir, a crypto startup, and then the AI startup.</p>
<p>I took about 6 weeks off to reflect on what I wanted to do next.</p>
<h3 id="reflection-and-experiment"><a class="toclink" href="../../2024/12/23/2024-wrapped/#reflection-and-experiment">Reflection and Experiment</a></h3>
<p>One key realisation was that identifying what would drive me was not easy, especially looking forward. The last time I felt that level of narrow focus was when I chose to do my PhD - there was no doubt whatsoever in my mind that I wanted to do it.
In fact there were many people who tried to talk me out of it, but I was convinced. And since finishing my PhD, I have oscillated between being driven by the impact, the people I work with, the day-to-day work, and the learning opportunities. At different times, each of these has been the primary driver.</p>
<p>Given this, I decided to do an experiment with two key constraints:</p>
<ol>
<li>I would explicitly not try to identify what would drive me, but instead set up transactional contracts. Tactically, this meant I would not take equity in any company I worked with. This would force me to be thoughtful about the time I spent on a project.</li>
<li>I would work at a slower pace - 4 days a week.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="early-results"><a class="toclink" href="../../2024/12/23/2024-wrapped/#early-results">Early Results</a></h3>
<p>Initially I was worried that I would not be able to find enough work. But I was pleasantly surprised. I managed to land a couple of consulting gigs - one with a boutique consulting firm, and another with a startup.
The consulting firm has been a great experience. I have been working with former Palantirians, and there's almost a sense of homecoming. The startup scratched the AI itch, giving me a chance to work on a real-world problem using AI.</p>
<p>The first couple of months went quickly - a honeymoon period of sorts. But one of the gigs ended, and I realised that I needed to be more proactive about finding work.
As someone who has no idea about sales, this was a challenge. Honestly, I freaked out a bit, but then I found my own way of generating leads.</p>
<h3 id="sales"><a class="toclink" href="../../2024/12/23/2024-wrapped/#sales">Sales</a></h3>
<p>I started writing more. I wrote about my experiences at Palantir, especially the hiring process. This resonated with a lot of people, and I started getting inbound leads.
Interestingly, not all were hiring related. I started working with another AI startup, a crypto startup, and a couple of hiring related projects.</p>
<p>So far this is the only way I have tried to generate leads, and it has worked well. I still don't feel confident that I will consistently manage to bring in business, but I will cross that bridge when I get there.</p>
<h3 id="hiring"><a class="toclink" href="../../2024/12/23/2024-wrapped/#hiring">Hiring</a></h3>
<p>The hiring projects have been the most non-trivial. I have worked with a few companies on their hiring, the most notable being <a href="https://www.comand.ai/">Comand AI</a>.
The level of trust they have placed in me has been humbling. Hiring is one of the most high-stakes things an early stage startup does, and I am grateful for the opportunity to help them.</p>
<p>It has also pushed me out of my comfort zone. Yes, I learnt a lot about hiring at Palantir, but fully owning the end to end outcome is a different beast. Additionally, I now also have to articulate my approach and be methodical about it - forcing me to rely less on instinct.</p>
<h3 id="highlights-and-conclusion"><a class="toclink" href="../../2024/12/23/2024-wrapped/#highlights-and-conclusion">Highlights and Conclusion</a></h3>
<p>Over the course of this year, I have worked on the following tech:</p>
<ul>
<li>Palantir Foundry</li>
<li>Python: to build LLM-based applications for the AI startups</li>
<li>Golang: to build tools in the crypto space for the crypto startup</li>
</ul>
<p>And I have learnt about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Golang concurrency</li>
<li>AI tools: Claude, Zed, Gemini, etc.</li>
<li>RAG architectures</li>
<li>Being a freelancer</li>
<li>Designing a hiring process</li>
</ul>
<p>I am happy with how the year has gone. I have managed to find work, and I have enjoyed the work I have done.
Interestingly, even though the experiment started off as transactional, I have found myself getting attached to the work. I have been invested in the outcomes, and I have cared about the people I have worked with.
This doesn't come as a surprise - I have always needed to care about the work I do, and/or the people I work with. But it's interesting to see how this has played out with the transactional initial conditions.</p>
<p>I am looking forward to 2025. I am excited about the work I have lined up - specifically in the AI space, as well as the hiring work.
The AI projects should give me the opportunity to learn and grow as an engineer, and the hiring work will give me the chance to learn how to build a business. I am not going to force my hand either way - we'll see how it goes.</p>

<p>Hiring is hard. It's difficult to figure out what makes a good hire.</p>
<p>If nothing else I have found these two qualities to be the most important in a hire:</p>
<ol>
<li>Critical thinking</li>
<li>Engagement</li>
</ol>
<p>I have often rejected candidates who were technically strong but lacked these two qualities.</p>
<h3 id="critical-thinking"><a class="toclink" href="../../2024/12/17/criticality-and-engagement/#critical-thinking">Critical Thinking</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"The day you don't feel comfortable disagreeing with me is the day we have lost our culture" - Shyam Sankar</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Shyam said this in one of the all hands at Palantir and it has stuck with me since then.</p>
<p>You want to hire people who are not afraid to disagree with you. You want to hire people who will challenge you.
Independent thinkers is what makes a company.</p>
<h3 id="engagement"><a class="toclink" href="../../2024/12/17/criticality-and-engagement/#engagement">Engagement</a></h3>
<p>Anyone who is genuinely interested in the work will naturally be a high performer. They will care about getting it right.
It aligns incentives.</p>
<p>This attitude is infectious, it is additive. It will rub off on the rest of the team.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion"><a class="toclink" href="../../2024/12/17/criticality-and-engagement/#conclusion">Conclusion</a></h3>
<p>Of course there are other qualities that are important, and I have written about them in the past. But these two, to some degree
are "must haves". Be on the lookout for them.</p>

    <h2 id="hiring-for-a-mission-driven-early-stage-startup"><a class="toclink" href="../../2024/12/12/hiring-for-a-mission-driven-early-stage-startup/">Hiring for a mission-driven early-stage startup</a></h2>
<p>I have recently had the privilege of working with the team at <a href="https://www.comand.ai/">Comand AI</a>.
Comand is a mission-driven startup that is building a platform to bolster NATO and NATO-aligned countries' defense capabilities by building products that help make operations more efficient and effective.</p>
<p>The company is at a very early stage and are currently sprinting towards finding product-market fit. At the same time they have a very clear mission and vision, and have seen early signs of traction in the market.
This means as they continue to gather user feedback and iterate on their product, they need to build a team that can move quickly and adapt to the changing needs of their customers.</p>
<h3 id="the-challenge"><a class="toclink" href="../../2024/12/12/hiring-for-a-mission-driven-early-stage-startup/#the-challenge">The Challenge</a></h3>
<p>The founding team at Comand AI is really strong on the technical side. It is exactly the kind of team you would expect to see at a mission-driven startup - highly motivated, technically strong, and deeply passionate about the problem they are solving.
However, they needed help in building out the team further. How do you identify the traits that would make someone successful in a mission-driven startup? How do you build a hiring process that can help you identify these traits?</p>
<p>At the pre-product-market-fit stage you generally want people who have spikes in at least one of the following two areas:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Highly Creative</strong>: They need to be someone who can explore the product space and come up with innovative solutions.</li>
<li><strong>Strong Execution</strong>: They need to be someone who can take a vague idea and turn it into a product really quickly.</li>
</ol>
<p>You either need someone who can chart out uncharted territories and come up with innovative ideas, or someone who can quickly build a prototype and test it out with users. Ideally both.</p>
<p>Separately, you need to be mindful of the mission-driven aspect of the company. You need people who are deeply passionate about the problem you are solving, and who are willing to go the extra mile to make sure you succeed.
And you need to think about the kind of culture you want to build. You want people who are collaborative, who are willing to take ownership of the outcome, and who are able to work effectively with others.</p>
<p>Designing a hiring process that can help identify these traits is crucial to building a team that can help you achieve your mission.</p>
<h3 id="the-process"><a class="toclink" href="../../2024/12/12/hiring-for-a-mission-driven-early-stage-startup/#the-process">The Process</a></h3>
<p>I started by understanding the current team makeup, their values, and the business goals they were trying to achieve. This was mapped to the hiring goals for the next 6 months.
I also did some ground work by shadowing a few interviews and understanding the current process. This revealed the different interviewing styles, their preferences, the kind of questions they were asking, and the synthesis process.</p>
<p>One of the main gaps I noticed was something I have written about before - being ok with
the <a href="../../2024/08/13/interviews-are-unfair/">unfairness of interviews</a>. 
The team has high empathy for the candidates, and at times this meant they were not making the hard decisions that were needed.
An empathetic interviewer is a good thing - being empathetic helps build a genuine connection with the candidate, but while synthesising the feedback, it is important to be objective. This is especially important when evaluating candidates who are good, but not great.
At such an early stage, you want to hire great people.</p>
<p>I also worked with the internal recruiting lead to design a process that would help identify the traits we were looking for. This included:</p>
<ul>
<li>A screening call with the internal officer and me to understand the candidate's motivations and values.</li>
<li>(Optional) Another domain-specific call with the technical lead to understand the candidate's technical capabilities.</li>
<li>Coding assessment.</li>
<li>Onsite interviews that included a mix of technical and behavioural interviews.</li>
<li>A founder interview to understand the candidate's alignment with the mission and vision of the company.</li>
</ul>
<p>The first screening call was designed to protect the team's time and ensure that only candidates who were deeply aligned with the mission and vision of the company were brought onsite.</p>
<p>We are still in the process of iterating on the process, but the early signs are promising. The team is excited about the candidates they are seeing, and the candidates are excited about the opportunity to work at Comand AI.
As we get more reps under our belt, we hope to add more rigor and accountability by introducing hiring theses to have a historical record of why we made the decisions we did, as well as to have an understanding of how and where to staff new hires.</p>
<h3 id="looking-forward"><a class="toclink" href="../../2024/12/12/hiring-for-a-mission-driven-early-stage-startup/#looking-forward">Looking Forward</a></h3>
<p>As Comand AI continues to grow, they will need to continue to iterate on their hiring process. They will need to think about how to scale the process, how to ensure that the process is fair and unbiased, and how to ensure that they are hiring the right people for the right roles.
And all of this without losing sight of the mission and vision of the company. But the passion and drive of the founding team was apparent since the beginning, and I am confident that they will be able to build a team that can help them achieve their goals.</p>
<p>Get in touch if you would like to work at Comand AI, or if you would like to know more about the hiring process we are building. I am always happy to chat about hiring, startups, and everything in between.
If you are currently in the process of hiring for your startup, and would like some help, feel free to reach out to me at <code>me@anjor.xyz</code>.</p>

<p>These past couple of weeks I have been working closely with the team at <a href="https://northslopetech.com">Northslope Technologies</a> on designing a hiring framework.</p>
<h3 id="the-challenge"><a class="toclink" href="../../2024/11/27/a-hiring-framework-for-a-new-kind-of-services-company/#the-challenge">The Challenge</a></h3>
<p>Founded by former Palantirians, Northslope is a professional services company that provides premium Foundry &amp; AIP development services. This shape of the company is unique in that it is a professional services company that has a product component, and still relies on elite technical talent to deliver services. This makes hiring a unique challenge.</p>
<p>On one hand you can't hire in the same way as you would for a consulting company. You want to hire people who will take ownership of the outcome, and not just be a pair of hands. On the other hand, you can't hire in the same way as you would for a product company. While building reusable product components is important for efficiency and scalability, the primary focus remains on delivering high-impact client outcomes, on short timeframes.</p>
<p>This means we need people who can balance both mindsets - who can leverage Foundry's capabilities to deliver client solutions efficiently, while also identifying opportunities to build reusable components that amplify our impact across multiple engagements.</p>
<h3 id="the-framework"><a class="toclink" href="../../2024/11/27/a-hiring-framework-for-a-new-kind-of-services-company/#the-framework">The Framework</a></h3>
<p>Given this unique challenge, we have been working on a hiring framework that is designed to identify and attract the right kind of talent. It starts with two key questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Are they smart?</li>
<li>Do they want to win?</li>
</ol>
<p>In some sense this is all you need to know about a candidate. If they are smart, they will learn and grow quickly - both on the technical side and on the business side. They will be creative, resourceful, and able to solve complex problems. If they have a desire to win, they will be able to deliver high-impact client solutions, build reusable product components, and help grow the business. They will be able to work effectively with clients, understand their needs, and deliver solutions that exceed their expectations.</p>
<p>This is obviously an oversimplification. If this is all we had on our hiring scorecard we would be missing a lot of important details. It also is highly subjective and prone to bias. But it is a useful starting point. Let's break it down further.</p>
<h4 id="what-does-it-mean-to-be-smart"><a class="toclink" href="../../2024/11/27/a-hiring-framework-for-a-new-kind-of-services-company/#what-does-it-mean-to-be-smart">What Does It Mean to Be Smart?</a></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Problem Solving:</strong> Are they analytical? Do they demonstrate empirical, evidence-based thinking? Can they break down complex problems into simpler components?</li>
<li><strong>Creativity:</strong> Are they able to think outside the box? Can they come up with innovative solutions to problems?</li>
<li><strong>Execution:</strong> Are they able to build a working solution? Can they take an idea from concept to reality?</li>
<li><strong>Customer Focus:</strong> Are they able to understand the needs of the client? Can they deliver solutions that meet or exceed their expectations?</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="what-does-it-mean-to-be-able-to-win"><a class="toclink" href="../../2024/11/27/a-hiring-framework-for-a-new-kind-of-services-company/#what-does-it-mean-to-be-able-to-win">What Does It Mean to Be Able to Win?</a></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Getting Things Done (GTD):</strong> Are they able to deliver results? Can they execute on their ideas and deliver high-impact solutions?</li>
<li><strong>Ownership:</strong> Are they able to take ownership of the outcome? Can they drive projects to completion and take responsibility for the results? Do they demonstrate a commitment to excellence?</li>
<li><strong>Low Ego:</strong> Are they able to work effectively with others? Can they collaborate with clients and team members to deliver solutions that meet everyone's needs?</li>
<li><strong>Criticality:</strong> Are they able to identify opportunities for improvement? Can they see the big picture and understand how their work fits into the larger context?</li>
<li><strong>Grit:</strong> Are they able to persevere in the face of challenges? Can they overcome obstacles and setbacks to achieve their goals?</li>
<li><strong>High Chaos Tolerance:</strong> Are they able to thrive in a fast-paced, high-pressure environment? Can they adapt to changing circumstances and deliver results under tight deadlines?</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-process"><a class="toclink" href="../../2024/11/27/a-hiring-framework-for-a-new-kind-of-services-company/#the-process">The Process</a></h3>
<p>We have developed an interview process that reflects these dimensions while remaining adaptable and evolving. Currently, it centers around three core components:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>An open-ended problem decomposition interview, where candidates work through an intentionally ambiguous challenge. This helps us evaluate their analytical thinking, creativity, and ability to navigate uncertainty - critical skills for client-facing work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A technical analysis and building exercise that assesses not just technical capability, but how candidates approach building solutions in practice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A behavioral interview that explores past experiences and approaches to challenges, helping us understand how candidates embody traits like ownership and grit in real-world situations.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="looking-forward"><a class="toclink" href="../../2024/11/27/a-hiring-framework-for-a-new-kind-of-services-company/#looking-forward">Looking Forward</a></h3>
<p>But perhaps more important than the specific format is our commitment to continuous refinement of the process itself. We regularly evaluate how well these interviews predict success in the role and adjust accordingly. This mirrors our broader approach at Northslope - we're building something new in the professional services space, and that requires being thoughtful and deliberate about every aspect of how we operate, including how we grow our team.</p>

    <h2 id="context-matters"><a class="toclink" href="../../2024/10/04/context-matters/">Context Matters</a></h2>
<p>Hiring is often viewed as a universal process -- "hire the best engineers, obviously!" -- but the reality is far more nuanced.</p>
<p>Hiring is deeply context-dependent, and understanding this can make the difference between building a thriving team and struggling with misaligned talent.
As someone who has worked extensively in hiring and team building, I've observed firsthand how crucial it is to align your hiring strategy with your company's current stage, technical needs, and overall vision. This blog post discusses three distinct scenarios I've recently encountered while consulting for different clients, each facing unique hiring challenges.</p>
<p>Through these examples, we'll explore:</p>
<ol>
<li>How a solo founder can build their founding team</li>
<li>The approach an early-stage startup should take when scaling their engineering team</li>
<li>Why a Series A startup needed to shift focus from engineering to operations</li>
</ol>
<p>Each case study offers insights into the critical thinking required to design effective hiring processes that go beyond simply filling roles. We'll discuss how to identify the truly important traits for each context, how to redesign job descriptions to attract the right candidates, and how to create interview processes that effectively evaluate the skills and attributes that matter most.</p>
<p>By the end of this post, you'll have a deeper understanding of why one-size-fits-all hiring rarely works, and how to approach hiring strategically based on your company's specific context and needs.</p>
<h3 id="client-1-a-solo-founder-hiring-their-founding-team"><a class="toclink" href="../../2024/10/04/context-matters/#client-1-a-solo-founder-hiring-their-founding-team">Client 1: A solo founder hiring their founding team</a></h3>
<p>I am working with a product-minded solo founder with a ML background who is looking to hire their founding team. Since they don't have a software engineering background, designing the right hiring process was a crucial problem to solve.</p>
<p>We started by identifying the critical first hire - an engineer who could help drive the technical vision of the company. The job description they had in place had a ton of technical jargon and was focused on the wrong things.
The critical insight here was while being pre-pmf, the first couple of engineers need to have spikes in one of the following two areas:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Highly Creative</strong>: They need to be someone who can explore the product space and come up with innovative solutions.</li>
<li><strong>Strong Execution</strong>: They need to be someone who can take a vague idea and turn it into a product really quickly.</li>
</ol>
<p>As you are trying to find your PMF, you need to be able to iterate quickly and try out a bunch of different things. This means you need to hire for speed and creativity, not for scale and robustness.</p>
<p>Once we aligned on this, we redesigned the job description to focus on these two areas and started sourcing candidates from our network.
We also started working on a technical interview process that would help us identify these traits in candidates using techniques from my previous posts on <a href="../../category/hiring/">hiring</a>.</p>
<h3 id="client-2-an-early-stage-startup-looking-to-scale"><a class="toclink" href="../../2024/10/04/context-matters/#client-2-an-early-stage-startup-looking-to-scale">Client 2: An early stage startup looking to scale</a></h3>
<p>This client is an early stage startup with about 10 engineers looking to scale to 20-30 engineers in the next 6 months. They have a couple of products showing early signs of traction and are looking to build out their engineering team.
The current team is very product-focused and has a strong engineering culture. They are looking to hire engineers who can come in and start contributing to the product quickly and autonomously.
The kind of profiles they are looking for are similar to the <a href="../../2024/07/03/forward-deployed-engineers-and-how-to-hire-them/">Forward Deployed Engineer</a> role at Palantir.</p>
<p>This was obviously an area I have a lot of experience in. The key value add here was helping them design a hiring process that would help them identify engineers who could come in and start contributing quickly.
This was done by first shadowing the current interviews and identifying the key areas where they were struggling to evaluate candidates - this could be questions they were asking, or the way they were synthesising the signal from the interviews.
I then gave the interviewers feedback on what's working well, and areas where they could improve. I even conducted a few interviews myself to help them calibrate their bar.</p>
<p>Even when you know what you are looking for, it is not always easy to evaluate it in an interview. This is where having an experienced interviewer can make a big difference.
During the interview, it is important to be ruthlessly objective about the signal you are getting. This means you form a hypothesis about the candidate, and then try to disprove it with your next question.</p>
<h3 id="client-3-a-series-a-startup-looking-to-expand-their-operational-team"><a class="toclink" href="../../2024/10/04/context-matters/#client-3-a-series-a-startup-looking-to-expand-their-operational-team">Client 3: A series A startup looking to expand their operational team</a></h3>
<p>This was a very different problem to solve. The core technical and operational strategy of the company relied more on the operational team than the engineering team.
Despite this their focus was on hiring engineers, and they were struggling to find the right profiles, and to keep them engaged once they joined.</p>
<p>The key insight here was that the operational team was the bottleneck in the company's growth, and they needed to hire for that team first. Once we aligned on this, we started working on a hiring process for the operational team.
We also worked on hiring a few key engineers who could help the operational team scale - this had a much wider impact than hiring engineers directly.</p>
<p>It is important to be true to your company's needs and not get caught up in the hype around hiring engineers. Sometimes the most impactful hires are not in the areas you initially think.
Having those honest conversations with the founders can make a big difference in the hiring strategy.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion"><a class="toclink" href="../../2024/10/04/context-matters/#conclusion">Conclusion</a></h3>
<p>Through these engagements I learned a lot about how context matters in hiring. Here are a few key takeaways:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Align with Your Stage</strong>: Whether you're pre-PMF, showing early traction, or entering a growth phase, your hiring needs will vary dramatically. Prioritize the skills and attributes that will drive your company forward at its current stage.</li>
<li><strong>Look Beyond Technical Skills</strong>: While technical proficiency is important, factors like creativity, execution speed, and cultural fit can be equally, if not more, crucial, especially in early-stage companies.</li>
<li><strong>Adapt Your Process</strong>: Your hiring process should reflect your company's needs and culture. Whether it's designing creative technical interviews, focusing on operational skills, or prioritizing autonomous contributors, tailor your approach to find the right fit.</li>
<li><strong>Understand Your Bottlenecks</strong>: Sometimes, the most impactful hires aren't in the areas you initially think. Be open to reassessing your needs and focusing on the roles that will truly drive your company's growth.</li>
<li><strong>Continuously Refine</strong>: As your company evolves, so too should your hiring strategy. Regularly reassess and adjust your approach to ensure you're attracting and selecting the talent that aligns with your current and future needs.</li>
</ol>
<p>Effective hiring is not just about filling roles; it's about building a team that can execute on your vision and drive your company forward. By understanding the nuances of your company's context – its stage, culture, and strategic goals – you can design a hiring process that not only attracts top talent but also ensures that talent is the right fit for your specific needs.</p>
<p>Remember, the goal isn't to hire the "best" people in absolute terms, but to hire the right people for your context. This mindset shift can make all the difference in building a team that's truly equipped to tackle your unique challenges and opportunities.</p>

    <h2 id="interviews-are-unfair"><a class="toclink" href="../../2024/08/13/interviews-are-unfair/">Interviews are Unfair</a></h2>
<p>And that's ok. </p>
<p>As I have <a href="../../2024/07/05/taking-bets-on-candidates/">mentioned</a> <a href="../../2024/07/10/motivational-interview/">before</a>, genuinely connecting with the candidate makes you an effective interviewer. Having high empathy for the candidate helps build that genuine connection. However, that makes it easy to fall into the "fairness trap". </p>
<h3 id="fairness-trap"><a class="toclink" href="../../2024/08/13/interviews-are-unfair/#fairness-trap">Fairness Trap</a></h3>
<p>"Fairness trap" is where you, the interviewer, hold yourself to a high standard of fairness. You want to do right by the candidate. It is natural - you have just spent a solid amount of time going through their background, and other interviewers' feedback, and then spent an hour or so interviewing them yourself - it makes sense that you feel a connection. But this connection can cloud your judgment, especially when evaluating candidates who are good, but not great.</p>
<h3 id="hiring-is-existential"><a class="toclink" href="../../2024/08/13/interviews-are-unfair/#hiring-is-existential">Hiring is Existential</a></h3>
<p>For early-stage companies, hiring is existential. Each new team member can significantly impact the company's trajectory. While you might have predetermined criteria for ideal candidates, meeting these baseline requirements isn't always enough.</p>
<p>When evaluating a candidate, consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>What new capabilities will this hire bring to the team?</li>
<li>How much potential for growth does the candidate have?</li>
<li>What is their "ceiling" - the maximum impact they could have on the company?</li>
</ul>
<p>These questions help you look beyond surface-level qualifications and consider the candidate's long-term value to your organization.</p>
<p>While data and criteria are important, don't underestimate the value of your intuition. Trust your gut feeling about a candidate, but be aware of your own biases.</p>
<h3 id="empathy-and-objectivity"><a class="toclink" href="../../2024/08/13/interviews-are-unfair/#empathy-and-objectivity">Empathy and Objectivity</a></h3>
<p>The key to effective interviewing lies in balancing empathy with objectivity:</p>
<ol>
<li>During the interview: Build a genuine connection with the candidate. Show empathy and create a comfortable environment for open discussion.</li>
<li>After the interview: Step back and evaluate objectively. Consider the candidate's fit, potential, and possible growth trajectories within your company.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="conclusion"><a class="toclink" href="../../2024/08/13/interviews-are-unfair/#conclusion">Conclusion</a></h3>
<p>Interviews are inherently unfair because they can never capture a person's full potential or fit within a short interaction. However, by acknowledging this limitation and consciously balancing empathy with objectivity, we can make more informed hiring decisions.</p>
<p>Remember, the goal isn't just to be fair to the candidate in the moment, but to make the best decision for your company's future. Sometimes, that means passing on a good candidate in hopes of finding a great one.</p>

    <h2 id="stochastic-growth-trajectory-good-or-bad"><a class="toclink" href="../../2024/08/11/stochastic-growth-trajectory-good-or-bad/">Stochastic Growth Trajectory: Good or Bad?</a></h2>
<p>We often have preconceived notions about the meaning of career growth. Typically, it's assumed to mean climbing the corporate ladder, moving into higher positions, and often transitioning into management. However, this linear path isn't the only way to grow professionally. My personal journey led me to experience a different approach: the stochastic growth trajectory.</p>
<h3 id="increasingly-confused"><a class="toclink" href="../../2024/08/11/stochastic-growth-trajectory-good-or-bad/#increasingly-confused">Increasingly Confused</a></h3>
<p>Throughout my career I have been nothing if not confused. In fact, the confusion has gone up over time. The last time I was confident of anything was when I was 13 years old - when I was convinced I wanted to do Physics. It was towards the end of grad school when I started considering leaving academia. But at that point I didn't know if anyone would hire me, and in what role. And I was really surprised to get hired by Palantir. This unexpected turn would shape my understanding of career growth in ways I couldn't have anticipated.</p>
<h3 id="palantirs-approach-to-growth"><a class="toclink" href="../../2024/08/11/stochastic-growth-trajectory-good-or-bad/#palantirs-approach-to-growth">Palantir's approach to Growth</a></h3>
<p>I spent 7 years at Palantir, and I can confidently say that I would not have stayed for that long if Palantir did not have the healthy approach to growth that it has. I got to explore a lot of different things in a relatively short timeframe. But there was more to it than just accelerated growth.</p>
<p>At Palantir it is expected that you own your growth. You are expected to be self-aware, critical, and intentional about how you grow. This is not an easy thing to do, especially early in your career. But it is what allows for people to grow into positions where they can have an outsized impact. It is also what keeps employees engaged and driven.</p>
<p>For me personally, this meant I was able to be an SRE, a Tech Lead, a backend developer, a product manager, a sales engineer, a data scientist, a data engineer, and a people manager during my 7 years at Palantir. This is what allowed me to go from managing a team of 20-25 people to being an IC dev on a backend team because I wanted to invest in my technical skills. Even when I moved from management to an IC role, I was still growing.</p>
<h3 id="flip-side"><a class="toclink" href="../../2024/08/11/stochastic-growth-trajectory-good-or-bad/#flip-side">Flip Side</a></h3>
<p>There is however a flip side to this. </p>
<p>Firstly, the responsibility of figuring out what growth means is completely on you. You have to figure out not just what growth means, but also how to grow in those areas. This can be quite hard. I was fortunate to have found the right leads, mentors and peers to help me.</p>
<p>Secondly, the micro-decisions you might make while trying to figure out what to work on next might not necessarily lead you to your macro-goals. To be honest, even today I am still figuring out what my macro-goals are. And the increasing awareness of not-knowing what I want to do gives me pause in figuring out what project to take on next.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion"><a class="toclink" href="../../2024/08/11/stochastic-growth-trajectory-good-or-bad/#conclusion">Conclusion</a></h3>
<p>I don't really have a conclusion for this post. I don't know if a stochastic growth trajectory is good or bad. Looking back I found the that "own your growth" worked for me, maybe. But it is not for everyone, and I don't even know if it worked for me or not. </p>
<p>Perhaps one way to think about it is to not worry much about macro-goals, especially if you don't have clarity about what they are. Instead focus on learning and growing in the near-term, and having faith that whatever you end up working on, there is a high chance that you will learn something new, and grow.</p>
<p>If you are curious, genuine, and keen to learn, you will land on your feet.</p>

<p>Hiring exceptional candidates is hard. In <a href="../../category/hiring/">previous posts</a> I have written about how one might go about identifying and interviewing strong candidates consistently.</p>
<p>In this post I would like to share a technique at the final stage of the hiring process that I have seen used at Palantir and Protocol Labs, and have found to be quite effective - namely, the hiring thesis.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-a-hiring-thesis"><a class="toclink" href="../../2024/08/02/hiring-theses/#what-is-a-hiring-thesis">What is a Hiring Thesis?</a></h3>
<p>A hiring thesis is a comprehensive document prepared by the hiring manager after making a decision to hire a candidate. It serves as a summary of why they chose this particular individual, highlighting their strengths and qualities that make them an ideal fit for the company.</p>
<p>This is not just a list of their strengths and weaknesses but a nuanced and thoughtful document.</p>

<ul>
<li>What projects or workstreams will this candidate have an outsized impact on? And what specific qualities will make that happen?</li>
<li>What is this candidate's ceiling? Is that an acceptable level and why?</li>
<li>What is this candidate's kryptonite? What projects/people should this candidate absolutely not work on/with?</li>
<li>What is the best case scenario?</li>
<li>What is the worst case scenario? How might we mitigate this?</li>
<li>Any advice for managers about what to look out for to help this person succeed?</li>

<p>It might seem like a lot of overhead to write this document for every hire, however, it is a useful exercise for multiple reasons.</p>
<ul>
<li>It increases confidence in the hiring decision by forcing you to consider multiple different scenarios</li>
<li>It provides as a guide for their manager for things to watch out for, staffing decisions etc.</li>
<li>It builds up a knowledge asset for the company and helps calibrate future interviewers/hiring managers.</li>
<li>Parts of the hiring thesis could also be used as a sell chat for the candidate!</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="conclusion"><a class="toclink" href="../../2024/08/02/hiring-theses/#conclusion">Conclusion</a></h3>
<p>The hiring thesis is a powerful tool that can significantly enhance your hiring process and set new team members up for success. By taking the time to articulate your thoughts and expectations for each new hire, you create a valuable resource that benefits not just the individual, but the entire organization.</p>
<p>Implementing a hiring thesis process may require some initial effort, but the long-term benefits far outweigh the investment. It promotes more thoughtful decision-making, provides a roadmap for employee development, and contributes to a culture of intentional growth within your company.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the hiring thesis is more than just a document—it's a commitment to nurturing talent and fostering an environment where both individuals and the company can thrive. By adopting this approach, you're not just filling positions; you're strategically building the future of your organization, one carefully considered hire at a time.</p>

<p>I have written <a href="../../2024/07/03/forward-deployed-engineers-and-how-to-hire-them/">before</a> about the Forward Deployed Engineer profile, and how hiring for that profile can be highly impactful for a company -- Palantir being a great example. In that blog post I also wrote a bit about how to hire FDEs. But honestly, re-reading that post I realised that the framework I wrote down though helpful to orient, does not give the means to assess whether or not your hiring is going well. </p>
<h3 id="one-hiring-manager"><a class="toclink" href="../../2024/07/18/how-did-palantir-hire-so-well/#one-hiring-manager">One Hiring Manager</a></h3>
<p>That got me thinking -- how did Palantir do it so well? What was the secret? Unfortunately, the answer is not an easy one. Palantir did things that do not scale for their hiring. During the time I interviewed there, there was 1 hiring manager for <strong>all</strong> engineering hires. This one individual was responsible for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gathering feedback from all the on-site interviews a candidate has been through: 3 per candidate.</li>
<li>Based on the synthesised feedback, design a bespoke hiring manager interview for the candidate that would gather signal that was missed during the on-site interviews.</li>
<li>After the interview, if decided to hire the candidate, write a thorough hiring thesis for the candidate.</li>
</ul>
<p>These were just the actual interviewing responsibilities. This same hiring manager was also the lead for the whole recruiting machinery:</p>
<ul>
<li>Working with recruiters to put together top of the funnel strategy.</li>
<li>Working with leadership and resourcing to understand headcount and/or specific geographical/profile needs.</li>
<li>Designing and running the internship program.</li>
<li>And most importantly recruit and calibrate new interviewers.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="conclusion"><a class="toclink" href="../../2024/07/18/how-did-palantir-hire-so-well/#conclusion">Conclusion</a></h3>
<p>By centralising the hiring function there was immense quality control over the hiring. But as you can imagine, it is hard work and can result in the individual burning out.</p>
<p>Like any other aspect of building a startup, this is a tradeoff. At early stage companies I do recommend founders and/or founding team to be involved in hiring as much as possible. You know your company and its culture better than anyone else. As you scale, if you can find an individual who is willing to take on the hiring function and keep it centralised as much as possible that is ideal for maintaining high quality bar. </p>

<h3 id="debugging"><a class="toclink" href="../../2024/07/12/debugging-interviewing-and-complex-systems/#debugging">Debugging</a></h3>
<p>Debugging is in its essence diagnosing the behaviours of a complex system. One needs to probe and observe the system to understand why it's doing something it's not supposed to do. Debugging using the scientific approach usually works quite well:</p>
<ol>
<li>Reason about collected data</li>
<li>Form a hypothesis.</li>
<li>Probe the system to test the hypothesis - this could be in the form of providing a certain input, collecting more data, or altering the underlying infrastructure. </li>
<li>If hypothesis is disproved - repeat 1 &amp; 2. </li>
</ol>
<h3 id="interviewing"><a class="toclink" href="../../2024/07/12/debugging-interviewing-and-complex-systems/#interviewing">Interviewing</a></h3>
<p>Interviewing is not that different from debugging in that sense. Your goal is to understand a fairly complex system, to develop a sense of how the system would perform in different situations. Approaching an interview with the same scientific approach can be an effective strategy.</p>
<ol>
<li>You start with some initial data - this would be the resume, or notes from other interviewers.</li>
<li>Form a hypothesis.</li>
<li>Ask a question that tests the hypothesis.</li>
<li>Go back to 1 and repeat until you are satisfied with your understanding of the system.</li>
</ol>
<p>For example, if you see a lot of academic projects on the resume, you may form the hypothesis that this is an individual who is academically inclined and might not end up prioritising the customer's needs. You could test that by asking questions like</p>
<ul>
<li>How do you go about prioritising your work?</li>
<li>What was the most important aspect of a project that you worked on?</li>
<li>Have you ever considered doing a PhD, why/why not?</li>
</ul>
<p>The answers will prove/disprove your hypothesis, but will also provide you with more information to form new hypotheses. </p>
<h3 id="conclusion"><a class="toclink" href="../../2024/07/12/debugging-interviewing-and-complex-systems/#conclusion">Conclusion</a></h3>
<p>A lot of engineers do not like interviewing. I find that a bit strange because as engineers we reason about complex systems on a daily basis. Interviewing is not that different. Taking a scientific approach to interviewing is not only effective, but will hopefully help you enjoy the process of interviewing - in turn making you a better interviewer.</p>
