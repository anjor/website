# Criticality and Engagement

Hiring is hard. It's difficult to figure out what makes a good hire.

If nothing else I have found these two qualities to be the most important in a hire:

1. Critical thinking
2. Engagement

I have often rejected candidates who were technically strong but lacked these two qualities.

## Critical Thinking

> "The day you don't feel comfortable disagreeing with me is the day we have lost our culture" - Shyam Sankar

Shyam said this in one of the all hands at Palantir and it has stuck with me since then.

You want to hire people who are not afraid to disagree with you. You want to hire people who will challenge you.
Independent thinkers is what makes a company.

## Engagement

Anyone who is genuinely interested in the work will naturally be a high performer. They will care about getting it right.
It aligns incentives.

This attitude is infectious, it is additive. It will rub off on the rest of the team.


## Conclusion

Of course there are other qualities that are important, and I have written about them in the past. But these two, to some degree
are "must haves". Be on the lookout for them.
