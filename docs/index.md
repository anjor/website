I help companies build elite technical organizations through hiring systems design and FDE-style organizational structure.

I write about what actually works in hiring—based on 7 years at Palantir, 1,000+ interviews, and building teams at Protocol Labs and multiple startups.

Currently running an experiment: rebuilding plasma physics simulations using AI to test whether intelligence explosion is real.

## About Me

PhD in Computational Physics. 7 years at Palantir as a Forward Deployed Engineer and hiring manager. Built engineering teams at Protocol Labs (onboarding 2+ petabytes to Filecoin) and Radiant AI.

I've conducted over 1,000 technical interviews and trained hundreds of interviewers. I built hiring systems that scaled from seed-stage startups to established companies.

Now I help ambitious companies build hiring systems that actually work and structure their engineering organizations around customer outcomes.

I'm also rebuilding my old plasma physics simulations using AI assistance—testing whether "intelligence explosion" is real by seeing if AI can accelerate research velocity.
