# Introduction

I am a seasoned software engineer with over a decade of experience. My career encompasses roles at industry leaders like [Palantir](https://www.palantir.com/) and [Protocol Labs](https://protocol.ai/), as well as a seed-stage startup [Radiant AI](https://radiantai.com), providing me with a unique perspective across varying scales of innovation. 

As a technical interviewer and hiring manager, I've conducted over 1,000 interviews, playing a crucial role in building high-performing teams. This extensive experience in talent assessment complements my technical expertise, enabling me to not only develop cutting-edge solutions but also identify and nurture top-tier technical talent.

I am currently an independent consultant helping companies in the following areas:
- Building and productionizing generative AI systems
- Building and productionizing data pipelines and operational workflows on top of Palantir Foundry
- Developing technical interview strategies and tools to accelerate hiring efforts
