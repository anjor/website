## Service Areas

### Hiring & Talent Systems

**The Hiring Blueprint**
**A one-time project to design and install your hiring engine.**

Ideal for early-stage teams (Seed - Series B) who need to build a repeatable hiring process from scratch.

**What's included:**
- Discovery & traits workshop: Define core attributes of success at your company
- Role definition & job descriptions that actually attract great people
- End-to-end interview process designed to test for your specific traits
- Custom interview kits: questions, technical challenges, scorecards
- Interviewer calibration: hands-on training to align your team

**Case studies:**
- [Comand AI](./writing/posts/comand-ai.md): Designed hiring for mission-driven engineers
- [Northslope Technologies](./writing/posts/smart-win.md): Built bespoke framework defining cultural traits vs role competencies

---

**Interviewing as a Service (IaaS)**
**On-demand expert interview capacity to scale your team without draining your engineers.**

Ideal for teams with an established process who need to increase hiring velocity while maintaining a high bar.

**What's included:**
- Technical and behavioral interviews conducted by Palantir/Google-trained experts
- Detailed candidate reports with clear hire/no-hire recommendations
- 24-hour turnaround

**Why it works:**
- Frees up hundreds of hours of your senior engineers' time
- Increases signal quality with unbiased, expert assessments
- Predictable operational expenditure to scale hiring

---

**Embedded Hiring Partner**
**Strategic partnership to build, lead, and execute your entire technical hiring function.**

Ideal for well-funded startups building a core team of 5-10+ engineers quickly and correctly, needing senior leadership without the full-time executive cost.

**What's included:**
- Full strategic oversight: Acting as your fractional Head of Talent / VP of Engineering for hiring
- All services from Hiring Blueprint and IaaS packages
- Plus: Weekly pipeline reviews, sourcing strategy, offer construction, closing support, onboarding design

### FDE & Organizational Strategy

**Forward Deployed Engineering Organization Design**

Design and implement Palantir-style FDE organizations from scratch. I help you:
- Structure teams around customer outcomes, not org charts
- Define the operating model that makes FDEs effective
- Build the culture of radical ownership
- Hire and onboard FDEs who can thrive in the model

This is the model that made Palantir successful. I spent 7 years as an FDE and know how to transplant it to other organizations.

**Case studies:**
- [Prodigal Tech](https://www.prodigaltech.com/): Building their FDE organization from the ground up
- [Fractal Analytics](https://fractal.ai/): Strategic advisory on FDE organizational design for enterprise AI business
- [Object Edge](https://www.objectedge.com/): Building Palantir services wing with FDE hiring and strategy

### AI Strategy & Adoption

**AI Implementation Strategy**

Most companies are experimenting with AI without a clear framework for what works. I help you:
- Understand where AI amplifies expertise vs where it fails (the autonomy gradient)
- Design validation methodologies for AI-generated outputs
- Build AI-assisted workflows that actually increase productivity
- Evaluate AI tools and platforms for your use case

Based on hands-on research: I rebuilt 3,500 lines of physics simulation code in 21 days using AI, documented everything, and published the [findings](https://github.com/anjor/gandalf-paper). I know what AI can and can't do because I've tested the limits.

**Technical Delivery**

When strategy isn't enough, I build:
- LLM applications and fine-tuning pipelines
- AI evaluation frameworks
- Proof-of-concept AI implementations

**Recent work:**
- [Metaview](https://metaview.ai): Built data asset for LLM fine-tuning and automated job description generation
- [Catena Labs](https://www.catena.xyz/): Developed libraries to benchmark and deploy LLM ensembles
- [Radiant AI](https://www.radiantai.com/): Designed LLM-based applications demonstrating governance capabilities

### Palantir Ecosystem Consulting

**For Companies Using or Considering Palantir**

I help organizations successfully adopt and implement Palantir Foundry:
- Technical strategy and architecture design
- Custom application development and data pipelines
- Production deployments and platform implementation
- Advisory on making Foundry work for your use case

**For Companies Building Palantir Services**

I help SI/consulting firms build their Palantir practice:
- Hiring FDEs who can succeed in Palantir ecosystem
- Training non-Palantir engineers on Foundry
- Strategic positioning in Palantir partner ecosystem
- Technical delivery for Foundry projects

**Recent work:**
- [Object Edge](https://www.objectedge.com/): Building Palantir services wing with FDE hiring and technical strategy

---

### Fractional CTO / Technical Advisory

Strategic guidance for technical decisions, architecture choices, and engineering leadership. Especially valuable for:
- Teams navigating complex technical transformations
- Early-stage companies needing senior technical leadership without full-time exec cost
- Organizations working across multiple domains (AI, blockchain, data infrastructure)

## Why Work With Me?

**Technical Credibility**
I'm not an ex-engineer advising from the sidelines. I recently completed rebuilding plasma physics simulations using AI—validating through hands-on research how AI amplifies expertise rather than replacing it. When I evaluate technical candidates or design technical interviews, I understand what great engineering looks like because I'm still doing it.

**Hiring Expertise at Scale**
1,000+ interviews. 600+ as hiring manager at Palantir. Trained hundreds of interviewers. Built hiring systems for companies from seed to Series B. Featured in [The Pragmatic Engineer](https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/forward-deployed-engineers).

**Organizational Design**
7 years as a Forward Deployed Engineer at Palantir. I understand how to structure teams around customer outcomes, not org charts. I've built FDE-style organizations from scratch and helped companies adopt the model.

The combination is rare: deep technical competence + hiring systems expertise + organizational design experience.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Do you do contingency recruiting / sourcing?**  
No. I design hiring systems and conduct interviews. For sourcing, I can recommend excellent recruiters or help you build an internal sourcing function.

**What makes your approach different from other hiring consultants?**  
Most hiring consultants are recruiters who learned to interview. I'm an engineer who learned to hire. I understand technical depth because I'm still building. I also have direct experience building systems at Palantir scale.

**Do you only work with startups?**  
No, but most of my clients are seed to Series B. The methodology works at any stage, but early-stage companies get the most value from building a system they own forever.

**Can you help with roles outside engineering?**  
Yes. The framework applies to any role. I've designed hiring for product managers, designers, and business roles. However, my strongest expertise is in technical roles.

**What's your typical engagement length?**  
Hiring Blueprint: 4-6 weeks. IaaS: ongoing monthly. Embedded Partner: 3-6 months minimum.

**Do you take equity?**  
For the right company at the right stage, yes. If you're pre-seed/seed and cash-constrained but building something exceptional, let's discuss a hybrid cash+equity arrangement. Email me.
