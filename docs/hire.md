## How We Work Together

### 1. The Hiring Blueprint
**A one-time project to design and install your hiring engine.**

Ideal for early-stage teams (Seed - Series B) who need to build a repeatable hiring process from scratch.

**What's included:**
- Discovery & traits workshop: Define core attributes of success at your company
- Role definition & job descriptions that actually attract great people
- End-to-end interview process designed to test for your specific traits
- Custom interview kits: questions, technical challenges, scorecards
- Interviewer calibration: hands-on training to align your team

**Case studies:**
- [Comand AI](../writing/2024/09/28/comand-ai-a-hiring-case-study/): Designed hiring for mission-driven engineers
- [Northslope Technologies](../writing/2024/11/20/case-study-building-a-hiring-process-for-northslope/): Built bespoke framework defining cultural traits vs role competencies

### 2. Interviewing as a Service (IaaS)
**On-demand expert interview capacity to scale your team without draining your engineers.**

Ideal for teams with an established process who need to increase hiring velocity while maintaining a high bar.

**What's included:**
- Technical and behavioral interviews conducted by Palantir/Google-trained experts
- Detailed candidate reports with clear hire/no-hire recommendations
- 24-hour turnaround

**Why it works:**
- Frees up hundreds of hours of your senior engineers' time
- Increases signal quality with unbiased, expert assessments
- Predictable operational expenditure to scale hiring

---

### 3. Embedded Hiring Partner
**Strategic partnership to build, lead, and execute your entire technical hiring function.**

Ideal for well-funded startups building a core team of 5-10+ engineers quickly and correctly, needing senior leadership without the full-time executive cost.

**What's included:**
- Full strategic oversight: Acting as your fractional Head of Talent / VP of Engineering for hiring
- All services from Hiring Blueprint and IaaS packages
- Plus: Weekly pipeline reviews, sourcing strategy, offer construction, closing support, onboarding design

## Additional Services

### FDE Organization Building
Design and implement Palantir-style forward deployed engineering organizations. Structure teams around customer outcomes, define operating models, build the culture of ownership that makes FDEs effective.

### Hands-On Technical Work
When strategic advice isn't enough, I build:
- **Generative AI applications**: LLM products, fine-tuning pipelines, evaluation frameworks
- **Blockchain development**: Smart contracts, data archival, Web3 infrastructure
- **Palantir Foundry**: Custom applications, data pipelines, production deployments
- **Computational physics**: Simulation development, numerical methods

### Fractional CTO / Technical Advisory
Strategic guidance for technical decisions, architecture choices, and engineering leadership. Especially valuable for teams working with Palantir Foundry or navigating complex technical transformations.

## Why Work With Me?

**Technical Credibility**
I'm not an ex-engineer advising from the sidelines. I'm currently rebuilding plasma physics simulations using AI—testing intelligence explosion through active research. When I evaluate technical candidates or design technical interviews, I understand what great engineering looks like because I'm still doing it.

**Hiring Expertise at Scale**
1,000+ interviews. 600+ as hiring manager at Palantir. Trained hundreds of interviewers. Built hiring systems for companies from seed to Series B. Featured in [The Pragmatic Engineer](https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/forward-deployed-engineers).

**Organizational Design**
7 years as a Forward Deployed Engineer at Palantir. I understand how to structure teams around customer outcomes, not org charts. I've built FDE-style organizations from scratch and helped companies adopt the model.

The combination is rare: deep technical competence + hiring systems expertise + organizational design experience.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Do you do contingency recruiting / sourcing?**  
No. I design hiring systems and conduct interviews. For sourcing, I can recommend excellent recruiters or help you build an internal sourcing function.

**What makes your approach different from other hiring consultants?**  
Most hiring consultants are recruiters who learned to interview. I'm an engineer who learned to hire. I understand technical depth because I'm still building. I also have direct experience building systems at Palantir scale.

**Do you only work with startups?**  
No, but most of my clients are seed to Series B. The methodology works at any stage, but early-stage companies get the most value from building a system they own forever.

**Can you help with roles outside engineering?**  
Yes. The framework applies to any role. I've designed hiring for product managers, designers, and business roles. However, my strongest expertise is in technical roles.

**What's your typical engagement length?**  
Hiring Blueprint: 4-6 weeks. IaaS: ongoing monthly. Embedded Partner: 3-6 months minimum.

**Do you take equity?**  
For the right company at the right stage, yes. If you're pre-seed/seed and cash-constrained but building something exceptional, let's discuss a hybrid cash+equity arrangement. Email me.
