# Hiring Theses

Hiring exceptional candidates is hard. In [previous posts](../category/hiring.md) I have written about how one might go about identifying and interviewing strong candidates consistently.

In this post I would like to share a technique at the final stage of the hiring process that I have seen used at Palantir and Protocol Labs, and have found to be quite effective - namely, the hiring thesis.

##  What is a Hiring Thesis?

A hiring thesis is a comprehensive document prepared by the hiring manager after making a decision to hire a candidate. It serves as a summary of why they chose this particular individual, highlighting their strengths and qualities that make them an ideal fit for the company.

This is not just a list of their strengths and weaknesses but a nuanced and thoughtful document.

### Key components of a good Hiring Thesis

- What projects or workstreams will this candidate have an outsized impact on? And what specific qualities will make that happen?
- What is this candidate's ceiling? Is that an acceptable level and why?
- What is this candidate's kryptonite? What projects/people should this candidate absolutely not work on/with?
- What is the best case scenario?
- What is the worst case scenario? How might we mitigate this?
- Any advice for managers about what to look out for to help this person succeed?


## Why is a Hiring Thesis important?

It might seem like a lot of overhead to write this document for every hire, however, it is a useful exercise for multiple reasons.

- It increases confidence in the hiring decision by forcing you to consider multiple different scenarios
- It provides as a guide for their manager for things to watch out for, staffing decisions etc.
- It builds up a knowledge asset for the company and helps calibrate future interviewers/hiring managers.
- Parts of the hiring thesis could also be used as a sell chat for the candidate!

## Conclusion


The hiring thesis is a powerful tool that can significantly enhance your hiring process and set new team members up for success. By taking the time to articulate your thoughts and expectations for each new hire, you create a valuable resource that benefits not just the individual, but the entire organization.

Implementing a hiring thesis process may require some initial effort, but the long-term benefits far outweigh the investment. It promotes more thoughtful decision-making, provides a roadmap for employee development, and contributes to a culture of intentional growth within your company.

Ultimately, the hiring thesis is more than just a documentâ€”it's a commitment to nurturing talent and fostering an environment where both individuals and the company can thrive. By adopting this approach, you're not just filling positions; you're strategically building the future of your organization, one carefully considered hire at a time.
